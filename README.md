# OpenWPM Introductory Project

## Introduction

In this mini-project, I conducted measurements to analyze the impact of using ad blocking extensions on top-100 websites, specifically comparing the third-party HTTP(S) requests, third-party cookies, and JavaScript API calls made by a browser in the “ad blocking mode” (ad blocking extension enabled) and the “vanilla mode” (ad blocking extension disabled).
 
## External Resources
I used an open source tool OpenWPM (https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM) for visiting websites to record HTTP(S) requests, cookies, and JavaScript API calls. The uBlock Origin extension for ad blockingis already built-in OpenWPM.
 
Please consult the instructions provided on the official Github page of OpenWPM (https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM) for further assistance.
